# Pig Dice Game

## Objective
Be the first player to reach a score of 50 points.

## Rules

1. **How to play:**
   - Your terminal. Run the file that has your code in it to initialize the game. Ex: If you have a directory called /pig/index.py run "python3 index.py"
or whatever you use to run python files.

2. **Gameplay:**
   - Players take turns rolling the dice, accumulating points in each turn.

3. **Scoring:**
   - Rolling a 1 on either die ends the player's turn, and they lose the turn's points.
   - Rolling a 1 on both dice results in a loss of all accumulated points in the game.

4. **Holding Points:**
   - Before rolling a 1, a player can choose to "hold" and add their turn's points to their overall score.

5. **Winning:**
   - The game continues until a player reaches the winning score of 50 points.

## Example Turn
- Roll the dice.
- If a 1 is rolled on either die, the turn ends with no points.
- Decide whether to continue rolling or hold to bank the accumulated points.

## Strategy
- Balance between rolling for more points and avoiding the risk of rolling a 1.
- Be the first to reach 50 points to win the game.
